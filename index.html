                        <li>I'm a software developer living in Portland, OR. Right now I split my time
                        between front end development and compiler engineering,
                        but I love learning about different areas of software
                        engineering, and will give everything a try.</li>                       
                        <li>I'm currently trying to learn more about compilers.</li>

                        <li>I earned a BS in Mathematics from the University of
                        Arizona. I loved studying math and still love math, and
                        the problem solving skills I learned through studying
                        math inform how I approach software and solving problems.

                          <li>For the past year I've been contributing to
                          the Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler of SpiderMonkey,
                          Mozilla's JavaScript engine that is written in
                          C/C++. It has been a great opportunity to grow
                          and learn as a C/C++ developer. I've enjoyed this
                          work immensely, and am currently trying to 
                          improve and broaden my skills as a compiler
                          developer.</li>
                          <li>Recently I started working on the Cranelift
